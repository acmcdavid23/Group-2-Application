RESUME FEATURE - TEAM MEMBER GUIDE
===================================

This folder contains all resume-related functionality. Work ONLY in this folder to avoid merge conflicts.

FILES TO EDIT:
- pages/resume.html - Main resume page HTML
- scripts/resume.js - All resume JavaScript logic
- styles/ - Add your CSS files here (create as needed)

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Don't edit files outside this feature folder
- Don't modify common/ scripts or styles
- Don't change the main index.html structure
- Don't modify Program.cs or other backend files

WORKFLOW:
1. All your HTML goes in pages/resume.html
2. All your JavaScript goes in scripts/resume.js
3. All your CSS goes in styles/ folder
4. Test your feature independently before committing

ROUTING:
- Your resume page will be accessible via the router
- Make sure your resume.html follows the same structure as other feature pages
- Use the existing router.js in common/scripts/ for navigation

BACKEND INTEGRATION:
- If you need backend changes, coordinate with the team
- Don't modify Program.cs or add new controllers without discussion
