Prerequisites

1. **Install Ollama**

   - **Windows/macOS:** Download and install from [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)

   After installing Ollama, close all open terminals and open a new one before running `ollama serve`. This ensures your system recognizes the new command.

   ollama serve
   This will start the Ollama API at [http://localhost:11434](http://localhost:11434).

4. Insure that both Ollama and the Program is running for full functionality.
   Open the Ollama app (or run `ollama serve` in a terminal).
   Keep the Ollama app open while using this project.
